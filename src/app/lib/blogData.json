Observers have also seen that there has been a rise in social movements using social media as a tool for communicating and organizing in times of political unrest.\n\nSocial media can also be used to read or share news, whether it is true or false.\n\nHistory\nSee also: Timeline of social media\nEarly computing\n\nFront panel of the 1969-era ARPANET Interface Message Processor\n\nIMP log for the first message sent over the Internet, using ARPANET\nThe PLATO system was launched in 1960 after being developed at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation. It offered early forms of social media features with 1973-era innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowdsourced online newspaper, and blog and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers.\n\nARPANET, which first came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s developed a rich cultural exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the network etiquette (or \"netiquette\") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[15] ARPANET evolved into the Internet following the publication of the first Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine in 1974.[16] This became the foundation of Usenet, conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, and established in 1980.\n\nA precursor of the electronic bulletin board system (BBS), known as Community Memory, appeared by 1973. True electronic BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978. Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on TRS-80, Apple II, Atari, IBM PC, Commodore 64, Sinclair, and similar personal computers. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s. Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s. Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.[17] Message forums (a specific structure of social media) arose with the BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. When the World Wide Web (WWW, or \"the web\") was added to the Internet in the mid-1990s, message forums migrated to the web, becoming Internet forums, primarily due to cheaper per-person access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously than telco modem banks.\n\nDigital imaging and semiconductor image sensor technology facilitated the development and rise of social media.[18] Advances in metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) semiconductor device fabrication, reaching smaller micron and then sub-micron levels during the 1980s–1990s, led to the development of the NMOS (n-type MOS) active-pixel sensor (APS) at Olympus in 1985,[19][20] and then the complementary MOS (CMOS) active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1993.[19][21] CMOS sensors enabled the mass proliferation of digital cameras and camera phones, which bolstered the rise of social media.[18]\n\nDevelopment of social-media platforms\n\nSixDegrees, launched in 1997, is often regarded as the first social media site.\nIn 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee integrated hypertext software with the Internet, he created the World Wide Web, marking the beginning of the modern era of networked communication. This breakthrough facilitated the formation of online communities and enabled support for offline groups through the use of weblogs, list servers, and email services. The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web 2.0.[8]\n\nSocial media started in the mid-1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities, Classmates.com, and SixDegrees.com.[22] While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time, SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for real people to connect using their actual names. It boasted features like profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations, making it \"the very first social networking site\" according to CBS News.[22][23] The platform's name was inspired by the \"six degrees of separation\" concept, which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else.[24]\n\nIn the early 2000s, social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace, followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, among others.[25]\n\nResearch from 2015 shows that the world spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[26] thus suggesting the popularity of social media platforms, likely fueled by the widespread adoption of smartphones.[27] There are as many as 4.76 billion social media users in the world[28] which, as of January 2023, equates to 59.4% of the total global population.\n\nDefinition and features\nThe idea that social media are defined simply by their ability to bring people together has been seen as too broad, as this would suggest that fundamentally different technologies like the telegraph and telephone are also social media.[29] The terminology is unclear, with some early researchers referring to social media as social networks or social networking services in the mid-2000s.[7] A more recent paper from 2015 reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four common features unique to then-current social media services:[2]\n\nWeb 2.0 Internet-based applications.[2][5]\nUser-generated content[2][5]\nUser-created self profiles[2][7]\nSocial network formed by connections between profiles,[2][7] such as followers or groups\nIn 2019, Merriam-Webster defined social media as \"forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).\"[30]\n\nWhile the variety of evolving stand-alone and built-in social media services makes it challenging to define them,[2] marketing and social media experts broadly agree that social media includes the following 13 types:[31]\n\nBlogs (ex. HuffPost, Boing Boing)\nBusiness networks (ex. LinkedIn, XING)\nCollaborative projects (ex. Mozilla)\nEnterprise social networks (ex. Yammer, Socialcast)\nForums (ex. Gaia Online, IGN)\nMicroblogs (ex. Twitter, Tumblr)\nPhoto sharing (ex. Flickr, Photobucket)\nProducts/services review (ex. Amazon, Upwork)\nSocial bookmarking (ex. Delicious, Pinterest)\nSocial gaming (ex. Mafia Wars, World of Warcraft)\nSocial network sites (ex. Facebook, Google+)\nVideo sharing (ex. YouTube, Vimeo)\nVirtual worlds (ex. Second Life, Twinity)\nSome services of other social media subtypes (such as Twitter and YouTube) also allow users to create a social network, and so are sometimes also included in the social network subtype.[7]\n\nMobile social media\nMobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Mobile social media are useful applications of mobile marketing because the creation, exchange, and circulation of user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development.[32] Mobile social media differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user (location-sensitivity) or the time delay between sending and receiving messages.\n\nSocial media promotes users to share content with others and display content in order to enhance a particular brand or product.[33] Social media allows people to be creative and share interesting ideas with their followers or fans. Certain social media applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are places where users share specific political or sports content. Many reporters and journalists produce updates and information on sports and political news. It can truly give users pertinent and necessary information to stay up to date on relevant news stories and topics. However, there is a downside to it. Users are advised to exercise due diligence when they are using social media platforms.\n\nAccording to Andreas Kaplan, mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:[32]\n\nSpace-timers (location and time-sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. Facebook Places, WhatsApp, Telegram, Foursquare)\nSpace-locators (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. Yelp, Qype, Tumblr, Fishbrain)\nQuick-timers (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy (e.g. posting on Twitter or status updates on Facebook)\nSlow-timers (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g. watching a YouTube video)",
